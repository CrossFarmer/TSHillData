# TSHillData
Initial version of TSHillData before starting the refactoring process, created to streamline data entry processes for Drill Pipe Inspections. This code reflects my early Python skills and is unrefined. Future commits will document my journey to refactor it into a clean, efficient, and professional-grade software project.
